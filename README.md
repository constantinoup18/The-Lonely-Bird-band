<h1>The Lonely Bird Band</h1>

    The Official "The Lonely Bird" band website allows die hard rock and roll fans to access the bands; information, 
    upcoming concerts and events, a gallery of the band doing what they love and contacting the band directly to 
    play live music for your own events. 

<h3>UX</h3>

When a user accesses a website they want simplicity. for simplicity the website is structured with sub-headings and headings that 
state what section they're reading. For example the "About the band" section. 

Users want to be able to seemlessly explore the website and all of the content it provides. with instructive buttons that open in the same tab
users can use the website toggling between the three different pages without clogging up their desktop with open tabs.

The colour scheme is easy on the eyes, for example if a user is in the dark, bright white and colours strain their eyes and make it 
difficult to read the information provided. the website, to prevent this as much as possible, provides an off-white background colour  and sublte
colour choices in the different sections alongside an off-grey text colour. 

<h3>Features</h3>

For simplicity with a hint of colour, the website on desktop home-page consists of a sleek design. the webpage background colour, so as to be gentle 
on the users eyes, is an off white with a grey-black text. the blue heading provides a splash of colour and is easy to take in visually.
The "upcoming events" section is a bold green with a vary of grey and black colour scheme as to draw attention to it but still kep it visually pleasing.
the home page provides a small image of the band and breif detail of who they are and what they do. the image is wrapped in-between the text to provide detail and maximize space.

Users want a website that is easy to use. The Home, Contact and Gallery pages all work to guide users to each page seemlessly. and on mobile the menu button 
has been collapsed to allow for more space and a sleeker design. 

Links to the social media pages of the band are included in the footer, opening up in a seperate tab so users can easily toggle between all
social media pages whislt still maintaining the original website for the band open in thier browser.

The contact form is instructive providing simple instructions on what field requires what information. Users can easily fill in the
form and submit their information with a big green submit button.

<h3>technologies Used</h3>

    In this website I have used CSS3 to style the content. 
    I have used bootstrap to provide a basic format to style upon.
    I have used HMTL5 to provide the structure of the page.
    I also used the Emmet Cheatsheet to allow shortcuts to writing code structure.
